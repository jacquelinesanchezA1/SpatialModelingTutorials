# Spatial Modeling Tutorials
SpatialModelingTutorials was developed to demonstrate function modeling, batch processing, and raster_tools functionality, along with various other coding and modelling strategies.

This collection of Notebooks is meant to demonstrate spatial modeling techniques that use parallel processing and the newly developed [Raster Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) package. Most notebooks are designed to run within Google's Colab. However, they can also be used locally if [Raster Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) is properly installed [link](./install_raster_tools.md).

To open a notebook within Colab, expand the [Notebooks](/Notebooks) directory and click on a given notebook. After the notebook opens in GitHub, click on the “Open in Colab” link (top left). Once in Colab you can step through each notebook cell.
